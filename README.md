# San_Fransisco_Crime_Aanalysis

An analysis of crime reports recorded by the San Francisco Police Department in 2016. Ideal viewing order of analysis is to begin with Offense Categories and move on to Incident Number file. Our goal was to display the distribution of crime in terms of location, time of day, week, and month. We accounted for both the raw number of reported offenses and frequency of individual occurances of crime (which may involve more than one offense). 

This information could be proved useful to residents, visitor, the police, and community leaders looking to examine appropriate distribution of resources. Our analysis is fairly simple, and given more time could be made much more in-depth analysis to involve census data and compare socioeconomic circumstances between populations in high crime areas. Javascript, html, css, matplolib and python API were used.
